He was responsible for leading the team developing electrical systems on the battery powered VTOL aircraft, which was a pioneering endeavour, and his team succeeded at this enormous task on time and on spec. What was really obvious is that Albert had strong, company wide respect for his technical skills, his leadership qualities and also simply being a delightful person. His grit to keep push in order keep the project on track is outstanding. I was personally saddened when he left the company, and I believe we are a poorer group for him not being here anymore. I wholeheartedly recommend Albert to any company or project looking for a technically brilliant engineer with enormous experience and great leadership skills."</p>
