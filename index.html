            <p>The objective of an engagement is to conduct a comprehensive review and to identify opportunities to enhance the R&D activities of the Client to be more effective and, for a young company, to mature the R&D methods and processes. This involves assessing the current product development planning and pipeline, direction and content, and suggesting an appropriate improvement plan.</p>
            <p>We will conduct a thorough analysis and investigation of the current structure and content of the Client’s R&D efforts. We will offer analyses and recommendations based on the review on how to improve and possibly better align R&D efforts with business strategy and market conditions. Quality and Reliability will be given special attention. Methods like Product Development Portfolio management, Phase Gate processes, Risk Analyses and Mitigation Assessments, Business case analyses of every R&D effort and other methods will be evaluated if useful to the Client. The overall technology roadmap will be reviewed (if not existing it will be drafted) and looked at for improvements.  We will also provide general training and coaching to the R&D team.</p>

                <li>Review current activities, documents and reports of the R&D efforts, product management and manufacturing functions</li>
                <li>Assess the effectiveness of the current R&D organization, resource allocation and incentive system</li>
                <li>Review in detail the short and medium term R&D plans of the Client, including issues such as prioritization and resource allocation for new product development, cost reduction opportunities, quality and reliability improvements, etc.</li>
                <li>Report on progress and findings to the Company at the end of the first round of interviews and reviews and initiate a detailed discussion of these findings with the Client. This report will be given verbally and supported with a written summary of key findings</li>
                <li>The goal after this discussion is to develop and agree with the Client, specifically the R&D management, on an improvement plan or revised R&D plan, with clear deliverables and performance benchmarks.</li>
                <li>Identify technology areas of strengths and areas with opportunities to improve through reviews and e.g.  organize or attend design workshops on specific ongoing projects, or technology areas currently of highest interest to the Client.</li>
                <li>Issue and present to the Client a draft written report at end of the this planning engagement</li>

                  <p>"I worked with Albert at Joby Aviation during a crunch-time effort to bring a flying prototype into operation. He was responsible for leading the team developing electrical systems on the battery powered VTOL aircraft, which was a pioneering endeavour, and his team succeeded at this enormous task on time and on spec. What was really obvious is that Albert had strong, company wide respect for his technical skills, his leadership qualities and also simply being a delightful person. His grit to keep push in order keep the project on track is outstanding. I was personally saddened when he left the company, and I believe we are a poorer group for him not being here anymore. I wholeheartedly recommend Albert to any company or project looking for a technically brilliant engineer with enormous experience and great leadership skills."</p>

                  <p>"Albert is a very unique person who has extensive and detailed knowledge about all aspects of data center systems and designs running the spectrum from electrical and mechanical systems but also has very detailed operating capabilities, that allow him to fluidly move between esoteric design discussions to the practical challenges associated with implementing them in commercial solutions at scale. We worked with Albert to deliver 20 MegaWatts of power in two different configurations which achieved among the lowest PUE's in the industry. He's a demanding and challenging client but also very fair and practical in his approach."</p>

                  <p>"Albert was my primary interface during one of my fastest ramping and most challenging customer engagements. The first production release started while the prototypes were in final testing. The aggressive schedule requirements outpaced material availability. Material lead times, design and schedule changes required a high level of direct involvement. Three projects followed in succession, increasing in size and complexity. Albert managed all functions and project challenges with a fraction of the standard operational resources. His hard work, dedication and professional expertise were invaluable to the overall success of the project. I look forward to working with Albert in the future."</p>
